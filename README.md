# Blockchain-based crowdfunding platform: `FundVerse`

**FundVerse** is a blockchain-based decentralized platform that combines social interactions with crowdfunding mechanisms, allowing any user to raise funds while becoming popular in the social network. Being **built over the Ethereum blockchain**, FundVerse is structured as a Decentralized Application **(DApp)**, that fosters crowdfunding without the intervention of any central authority,and recognizes the active role of donors, enabling them to support artists or projects as well as humanity use cases.


## Why blockchain based crowdfunding?

- Blockchain is a **decentralized ledger** that records network transactions securely and transparently hence contributors can determine how legitimate the campaign is?
- There is **no minimum contribution requirement** i.e Contributors have the freedom to support campaigns with any amount they choose
-‌ Better **flexibility** and **accessibility** leads to **improved** reach of campaigns
- Blockchain is **immutable** and support real time monitoring of data
-‌ Whereas, **DApps** are the applications that **run without downtime**, fraud, or any sort of regulations.


## Technologies Utilised:

- **Backend** ( **Web 3** folder ): Solidity
- **Frontend** ( **Client** folder ): Javascript, React Js, Tailwind CSS,etc
- We have used **Thirdweb** and **Hardhat** to create and deploy the dApp on **Sepolia testnet.**

**Thirdweb** is a tool for creating, deploying, and managing dApps on the Ethereum blockchain and **hardhat** is a development environment for Ethereum smart contract development.


## Challenges faced While Building this project:

Though there were many but some of the major challenges we faced while building this crowdfunding DApp are:
- Migrating from Goerli testnet to Sepolia testnet
- Integration of Sepolia test network with the Ethereum Blockchain
- Keeping an eye on deprecated standards of web3 adding new functionality to the DApp
